# NFL Longevity Predictor
Longevity Predictor for players in the NFL based on Combine Data


# Project Proposal 
Our project is to make a model that can predict how long a player can play in the NFL using data from the NFL combine. There has been research that has concluded that it is possible to predict player performance and career longevity using past results from the NFL Combine *(1)(2)*. The NFL combine is one of the most significant tools used by scouts today to help determine who they should draft for their team. They administer a series of physical tests to each player in order for them to create a scouting report to help determine if they are qualified for the position *(6)*. Over time as the NFL grew, there have been questions on whether a player's performance in the Combine has a correlation to how well they succeed and last in the league *(5)*. If that correlation does exist, is it possible to use the players' Combine reports to determine how new players coming into the NFL will fare *(4)*. Our goal is to create a Combine predictor to determine the future of the new NFL class. We want to be able to look at these young players and predict how their careers will pan out and hopefully quantify their fitness to assist with NFL scouting. This can help us pick players we believe will stay in the league long and do well so teams can get a good return on investment. The data set we are working with tracks every player's Combine stats, such as 40-yard time and verticals in the last 35 years. We then use that dataset to compare it with the same players' NFL stats focusing on those that prove sustainability and success, such as snap count, years played, games played, and pro bowls. The methods we were thinking of applying included SVM (Support Vector Machines) using classification and regression since research indicates that this model is suitable for sports performance prediction *(3)*. Some of the results we are looking for are to create a relationship between players scouting reports to their pro bowls and longevity. Once we have this relationship, we should be able to give an estimate of a new player in the draft. The metrics that we will use to show this are the number of Probowls that a new player will probably receive, how many years they will play, and the time that they will play. We can then use these to predict what players we would want to draft based on what the stats show. Looking into how we can apply that today, we can look at how players that have recently been drafted, such as George Pickens, Kenny Pickett, and Breece Hall, will sustain in the current NFL given how well they did in the combine. Looking into the future, we should be able to quantify how many seasons a player like Jeff Sims will last once he does his draft and see if he looks like someone worth drafting.
